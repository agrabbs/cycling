# cycling
This is where I store all of my automation in regards to cycling.
Here you will find scripts that will complete tasks that you may

* Strava
	* kudos.py - logs in and gives kudos until it runs out. 
	__WARNING__ during test Strava temporarily suspended me. 
	It might have been from too many logins.
